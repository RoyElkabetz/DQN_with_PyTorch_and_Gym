# DQN variations using PyTorch and Jym

This repo contains a PyTorch written DQN, DDQN, DuelingDQN and DuelingDDQN implementations, following the next Google DeepMind's papers:

- [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236) (2015)
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) (2015)
- [Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581) (2016)

## Background
In the first paper above (Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning (2005)) the authors stated *"We set out to create a single algorithm that would be able to develop a wide range of competencies on a varied range of challenging tasks â€” a central goal of general artificial intelligence"*. The main advantages in estimating the **Q-value function** using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) are, (1) the identical network can be used in a veraiety of very different games and sequential tasks, (2) The complexity of the training does not scale trivially with the size of the (state, action) space, which means that using a pretty small DNN (comparing to real-life applications solved using DNNs) even a very large (state, action) space can be modeled without a problem.
